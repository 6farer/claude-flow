# Claude Code MCP – `code-flow` Mode

This MCP (Model Context Protocol) mode defines a **code execution and refinement flow** using **Claude Code** as the reasoning engine. It's designed for RooCode-style agentic environments where AI agents operate recursively, orchestrating the build process through contextual task flows.

This mode serves as a **code-first orchestration layer**, enabling Claude to write, edit, test, and optimize code autonomously across recursive agent cycles while maintaining coherent development patterns and architectural integrity.

## 🔄 What is Claude Code MCP?

Claude Code MCP combines Claude's advanced language capabilities with structured MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for deterministic code operations. Unlike traditional prompting approaches, MCP provides Claude with direct, reliable access to:

- **File System Operations**: Read, write, search, and manipulate files with precision
- **Code Analysis Tools**: AST parsing, dependency mapping, and structural analysis
- **Test Execution Environments**: Real-time test running and validation
- **Version Control Integration**: Git operations and change tracking
- **Build System Integration**: Compilation, bundling, and deployment workflows

This enables Claude to operate as a true development agent rather than just a code generator, making informed decisions based on actual codebase state and test results.

    "max_file_size": 500,
    "test_timeout": 30000,
    "quality_threshold": 0.8,
    "auto_format": true,
    "auto_lint": true
  }
}
```

---

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Tool Integration

Add custom MCP tools by extending the tool registry:

```typescript
// tools/custom-analyzer.ts
export class CustomAnalyzer implements MCPTool {
  name = "custom_analyze";
  
  async execute(params: any): Promise<any> {
    // Custom analysis logic
    return {
      complexity: calculateComplexity(params.code),
      suggestions: generateSuggestions(params.code)
    };
  }
}
```

### Mode Chaining

Configure automatic mode transitions:

```json
{
  "mode_chains": {
    "code-flow": {
      "on_success": ["doc-writer", "security-scanner"],
      "on_failure": ["critic", "reflection"],
      "on_optimization": ["performance-analyzer"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Tests failing after code generation
```bash
# Check test configuration
npm run test:debug
# Review generated code
cat generated_file.ts
```

**Issue**: MCP connection errors
```bash
# Verify MCP server status
curl http://localhost:3001/health
# Check logs
tail -f logs/mcp.log
```

**Issue**: High token usage
- Reduce context window size in configuration
- Enable delta-only mode for large files
- Use file chunking for massive codebases

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging:

```json
{
  "debug": {
    "enabled": true,
    "level": "verbose",
    "output": "logs/debug.log"
  }
}
```

## 📣 Coming Soon

I'll be sharing a comprehensive walkthrough on how this integrates with my broader agentic stack using RooCode and SPARC workflows. This will include:

- **Recursive Build Loops**: How Claude assembles and deploys MCP configurations autonomously
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinating specialized agents for complex development tasks
- **Continuous Learning**: How the system improves its coding patterns over time
- **Production Deployment**: Real-world case studies and performance analysis

---

## 🧭 Philosophy

This isn't just about making Claude write code. It's about making it **think through code recursively**—like an engineer, not just a scribe.

The goal is to create a development partner that:
- **Understands context** deeply across multiple files and systems
- **Maintains consistency** with established patterns and architecture
- **Learns continuously** from feedback and results
- **Operates autonomously** while remaining transparent and controllable

If you're building agentic systems and want to explore the depths of autonomous orchestration, `code-flow` is where the real engineering work begins.
